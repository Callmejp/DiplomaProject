## This directory includes the code of preparatory work.
Most of the code comes from its github. l just use some parts of them to 
achieve my purpose.

### `get_normalized_image.py`
It will compute the optical flow of raw images and generate 
new images. And these new images will be inputted to a CNN
to predict steering angles in `test.py`.

### `trans_pic_to_csv.py`
l want to continue to use the data format of DeepPoly. So l
write it to transform the pictures generated by `get_normalized_image.py`
into a csv file. 

### `autumn.csv`
Each line of it is a picture's one-dimensional representation.
And it has 16 lines, i.e., it only has 16 case.

### `model`
It includes the trained result. And it will be used by DeepPoly to import the 
graph.
