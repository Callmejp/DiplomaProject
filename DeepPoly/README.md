To use DeepPoly to test specific neural networks, you need to modify the code
further.
### Details:
1. l use `#############` to wrap the code l have changed.
2. l only list the file l made modification on.
3. Maybe you will find `main.py` contains new code that
haven't be wrapped. Because l think these changes are general.
